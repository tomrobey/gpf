             <p>It's like a bus in the sky. But you can't just get 
                 off at the next town. Some parts of flying are great, like the 
                 views at times. Much of the time it can be something you
                  just want to get over and done with. Why not 
                increase your chances of making it fun and enjoyable. And 
                when you land, you go on your merry way. With a better memory
                of the flight to boot!
